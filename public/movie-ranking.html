<h1>The Best Movies According to Dieumer</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Coming to America </h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie due to the comedy of Eddie Murphy, the love story and the general nostalgia of 90s NYC.</p>
<h3>Dune 2</h3>
<p>I like this action movie for the immersion into a sci-fi world.</p>
<h3>The Ten Commandments</h3>
<p>I've watched this movie so many times as a kid and always thought the poetry of the dialogue to be incredible.</p>
