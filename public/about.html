<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Full Stack Developer that is passionate about technology and the powerful tools one can build with it.</p>

<p> I earned my bachelors of science degree from the University of Central Florida and have worked in Healthcare Revenue cycle, Adult Learning & Development, large scale Organizational Change Management and within the Trust & Saftey space crafting policy and enforcement. This wealth of experience has
  given me a depth of knowledge in various interconnected domains that can be leveraged to the benefit of almost any industry.
</p>

<p>My pivot into technology and coding proper, has been a gradual but steady shift from Project and Program Management. From my days in healthcare over to healthcare IT and then to a large Technology firm proper and now back in healthcare software project management. The IT side
  of healthcare has always facinated me simply for how much unmet need is present. This site exist primarily to demonstrate my learnings and coding capacity, with the aim of securing full time coding roles. Feel free to contact me! Lets talk!
